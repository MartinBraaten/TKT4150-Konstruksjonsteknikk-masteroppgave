# TKT4150-Konstruksjonsteknikk-masteroppgave

This repo contains the code I used to process and analyze the data I collected during my master thesis in Constructional Engineering. The title of my thesis was "Fatigue of Glued Laminated Timber in Shear", and contains analysis of static strength tests, linear regression for S-N curves and force-displacement analysis. The thesis will be publicly available from 2024-06-29. More information regarding my thesis can be found <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/11250/2826377"><strong>here</strong></a>.

Note: Some of the names of the variables doesn't actually describe what the variable is, and this is something I have stopped doing since.
